3. Understanding Ohm's Law
============================

Every electronic device is made up of circuits and circuit boards. To ensure these devices operate correctly, electrical engineers need to precisely understand and control the flow of electricity. Known physical laws dictate the behavior of electric current within these circuits. In this lesson, you'll explore one of these laws: Ohm's Law.

In this lesson, you will learn about Ohm's Law. You will also build series and parallel circuits and study the behavior of electrical measurements such as voltage in these circuits. Using a tool called a multimeter, you will measure the voltage in the circuits you build.

In this exciting lesson, you'll:

* Connect schematic diagrams with actual circuits.
* Explore the relationship between resistance, current, and voltage in circuits (Ohm's Law).
* Use a multimeter to measure resistance and voltage.
* Build series and parallel circuits using a breadboard.
* Compare the behavior of voltage in series and parallel circuits.
