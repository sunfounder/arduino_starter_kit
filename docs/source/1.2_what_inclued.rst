1.2 What's Included in Your Kit
======================================


Inside our kit, you'll find a variety of components and parts you'll use throughout this course to build circuits. Here's a quick guide to what's included.


**R3 Board**

A microcontroller board that's the brain of your circuits. It has everything needed to support the microcontroller; simply connect it to your computer with a USB cable or power it with an AC-to-DC adapter or battery to get started.

**Breadboard**

A solderless board that lets you easily build electronic circuits. It's filled with rows of holes for connecting wires and components.

**Resistors**

A resistor is a component that obstructs the flow of electric power, thereby altering the voltage and current within a circuit. The value of a resistor is measured in ohms, symbolized by the Greek letter omega (Î©). The colored stripes on a resistor indicate its resistance value and tolerance.

**Light-Emitting Diode (LED)**

When current flows through, it lights up. Used as indicators on devices, for colorful displays in TVs, and as energy-efficient lighting.

**RGB LED**

Combines red, green, and blue LEDs in one casing. It can display various colors by adjusting the input voltage, creating millions of colors.

**NTC Thermistor**

A thermistor is a resistor sensitive to temperature changes. NTC thermistors decrease resistance as temperature rises, while PTC thermistors increase resistance with temperature.

**Potentiometer**

A potentiometer is a variable resistor with three pins. Two pins connect to the ends of a resistor, while the middle pin attaches to a movable wiper, dividing the resistor into two parts. Potentiometers, often used to adjust voltage in circuits, are like the volume knobs on radios.

**Button**

Closes the circuit when pressed, opens when released. Lets the Arduino detect on/off signals.

**7-segment Display**

A 7-segment display is an 8-shaped component which packages 7 LEDs. Each LED is called a segment - when energized, one segment forms part of a numeral to be displayed.
