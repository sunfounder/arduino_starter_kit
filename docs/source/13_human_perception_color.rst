13. The Spectrum of Sight
================================================================================
Welcome to this lesson,  where we unravel the mystery of human color perception and replicate it using technology. In this lesson, we delve into how our eyes distinguish millions of colors and how this incredible ability can be simulated digitally with RGB LEDs. By exploring the interplay of photoreceptors in our eyes and the RGB color model, you'll learn to recreate the vividness of the world in digital form.

**Overview**

The human visual system can perceive about ten million different colors, a capability achieved through photoreceptor cells in the retina‚Äîcones and rods. Perception of color is not linear; our visual system is more sensitive to changes in certain colors than others. Cones, which are sensitive to color, primarily come in three types, each most sensitive to either red, green, or blue light.

The human eye perceives about ten million different colors, thanks to specialized cells in the retina called cones and rods. This perception isn't uniform across the spectrum; we're more sensitive to changes in some colors than others. Cones, which detect color, are predominantly sensitive to red, green, or blue wavelengths.

The RGB color model is an additive color model where colors are created by mixing varying intensities of red, green, and blue light. In this model, red, green, and blue are typically considered primary color channels. By adjusting the intensity of each channel (from 0 to a maximum value, typically 255 corresponding to an 8-bit color depth), it is possible to produce a visible spectrum of over 16 million different colors. For instance, orange can be achieved by mixing more red with less green.

The RGB color model uses an additive approach, mixing red, green, and blue light to create a broad array of colors. This model reflects how our visual system combines light from different parts of the spectrum to form diverse hues. By manipulating the intensity of these three primary colors, we can generate over 16 million distinct colors. For example, by increasing red and decreasing green, we achieve orange.

Code Creation - Displaying Colors
------------------------------------

In our journey to master the control of RGB LEDs, we've seen how using ``digitalWrite()`` can light up the LED in basic colors. To further explore and unlock the full spectrum of colors that an RGB LED can produce, we'll now delve into using ``analogWrite()`` to send PWM (Pulse Width Modulation) signals, allowing us to achieve a wide range of hues.

Let's see how we can implement this with code.

1. Open the Arduino IDE and start a new project by selecting ‚ÄúNew Sketch‚Äù from the ‚ÄúFile‚Äù menu.
2. Save your sketch as ``Lesson13_PWM_Color_Mixing`` using ``Ctrl + S`` or by clicking ‚ÄúSave‚Äù.

3. First, set the three pins of the RGB LED as outputs:

.. code-block:: Arduino
    :emphasize-lines: 3-5

    void setup() {
        // Set up code to run once:
        pinMode(9, OUTPUT);   // Set Blue pin of RGB LED as output
        pinMode(10, OUTPUT);  // Set Green pin of RGB LED as output
        pinMode(11, OUTPUT);  // Set Red pin of RGB LED as output
    }

4. Use ``analogWrite()`` to send PWM values to the RGB LED. From Lesson 9, we know that PWM values can change an LED's brightness, and the PWM range is 0-255. To display red, we set the PWM value of the RGB LED's red pin to 255, and the other two pins to 0.

.. code-block:: Arduino
    :emphasize-lines: 10-12

    void setup() {
        // Set up code to run once:
        pinMode(9, OUTPUT);   // Set Blue pin of RGB LED as output
        pinMode(10, OUTPUT);  // Set Green pin of RGB LED as output
        pinMode(11, OUTPUT);  // Set Red pin of RGB LED as output
    }

    void loop() {
        // Main code to run repeatedly:
        analogWrite(9, 0);    // Set the PWM value of Blue pin to 0
        analogWrite(10, 0);   // Set the PWM value of Green pin to 0
        analogWrite(11, 255);  // Set the PWM value of Red pin to 255
    }

5. With this setup, after uploading the code to the Arduino Uno R3, you will see the RGB LED display red.

6. The ``analogWrite()`` function allows the RGB LED to display not only the seven basic colors but many other different hues. Now you can adjust the values of pins 9, 10, and 11 separately, and record the observed colors in your handbook.

.. list-table::
    :widths: 20 20 20 40
    :header-rows: 1

    *   - Red Pin    
        - Green Pin

        - 
    *   - 255
        - 128
        - 0
        -     

Code Creation - Parameterized Functions
------------------------------------------------

Using the ``analogWrite()`` function to display different colors can make your code lengthy if you want to display many colors simultaneously. Therefore, we need to create functions.

Unlike the previous lesson, we are preparing to create a function with parameters. 


A parameterized function allows you to pass specific values into the function, which can then use these values to perform its tasks. This is incredibly useful for adjusting properties like color intensity on the fly. It makes your code more flexible and easier to read.

When defining a parameterized function, you specify what values it needs to operate through parameters listed in parentheses right after the function name. These parameters act like placeholders that get replaced by actual values when the function is called.

Here's how to define a parameterized function for setting the color of an RGB LED:

1. Open the sketch you saved earlier, ``Lesson13_PWM_Color_Mixing``. 

2. Hit ‚ÄúSave As...‚Äù from the ‚ÄúFile‚Äù menu, and rename it to ``Lesson13_PWM_Color_Mixing_Function``. Click "Save".

3. Start by declaring the function after the ``void loop()`` with the keyword ``void``, followed by the function name and parameters in parentheses. For our ``setColor`` function, we'll use three parameters‚Äî ``red``, ``green``, and ``blue``‚Äîeach representing the intensity of the corresponding color component of the RGB LED.

.. code-block:: Arduino
    :emphasize-lines: 5,6

    void loop() {
        // put your main code here, to run repeatedly:
    }

    void setColor(int red, int green, int blue) {
    }

   
4. Within the function body, use the ``analogWrite()`` command to send PWM signals to the RGB LED pins. The values passed to ``setColor`` will determine the brightness of each color. The parameters ``red``, ``green``, and ``blue`` are used here to directly control the intensity of each LED pin.

.. code-block:: Arduino

    // Function to set the color of the RGB LED
    void setColor(int red, int green, int blue) {
        // Write PWM value for red, green, and blue to the RGB LED
        analogWrite(11, red);
        analogWrite(10, green);
        analogWrite(9, blue);
    }


5. Now you can call your newly created ``setColor()`` function in the ``void loop()``. Since you created a function with parameters, you need to fill in the arguments in the ``()`` such as ``(255, 0, 0)``. Remember to write comments.

.. code-block:: Arduino
    :emphasize-lines: 3

    void loop() {
        // put your main code here, to run repeatedly:
        setColor(255, 0, 0); // Display red color
    }

    // Function to set the color of the RGB LED
    void setColor(int red, int green, int blue) {
        // Write PWM value for red, green, and blue to the RGB LED
        analogWrite(11, red);
        analogWrite(10, green);
        analogWrite(9, blue);
    }

6. We already know that by providing different values to the three pins of the RGB LED, we can light up different colors of light. So, how do we make the RGB LED light up exactly the color we want? This requires the aid of a color palette. Open **Paint** (this software comes with Windows) or any drawing software on your personal computer.

7. Choose a color you like, record its RGB values.

.. note::

    Note that before you select a color, adjust the lumens to the proper position.

.. image:: img/13_mix_color_paint_2.png

8. Fill in the color you selected into the ``setColor()`` function in the ``void loop()``, use the ``delay()`` function to specify the display time for each color.

.. code-block:: Arduino

    void loop() {
        // put your main code here, to run repeatedly:
        setColor(255, 0, 0);      // Display red color
        delay(1000);              // Wait for 1 second
        setColor(0, 128, 128);    // Display teal color
        delay(1000);              // Wait for 1 second
        setColor(128, 0, 255);    // Display purple color
        delay(1000);              // Wait for 1 second
        setColor(128, 128, 255);  // Display Light blue color
        delay(1000);              // Wait for 1 second
        setColor(255, 128, 0);    // Display orange color
        delay(1000);              // Wait for 1 second
    }

9. Below is the complete code; you can click "Upload" to upload the code to the Arduino Uno R3 to see the effects.

.. code-block:: Arduino

    void setup() {
        // put your setup code here, to run once:
        pinMode(9, OUTPUT);   // Set Blue pin of RGB LED as output
        pinMode(10, OUTPUT);  // Set Green pin of RGB LED as output
        pinMode(11, OUTPUT);  // Set Red pin of RGB LED as output
    }

    void loop() {
        // put your main code here, to run repeatedly:
        setColor(255, 0, 0);      // Display red color
        delay(1000);              // Wait for 1 second
        setColor(0, 128, 128);    // Display teal color
        delay(1000);              // Wait for 1 second
        setColor(128, 0, 255);    // Display purple color
        delay(1000);              // Wait for 1 second
        setColor(128, 128, 255);  // Display Light blue color
        delay(1000);              // Wait for 1 second
        setColor(255, 128, 0);    // Display orange color
        delay(1000);              // Wait for 1 second
    }

    // Function to set the color of the RGB LED
    void setColor(int red, int green, int blue) {
        // Write PWM value for red, green, and blue to the RGB LED
        analogWrite(11, red);
        analogWrite(10, green);
        analogWrite(9, blue);
    }

10. Finally, remember to save your code and tidy up your workspace.
